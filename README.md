# ðŸš² Ford GoBike Trip Data Analysis (January 2018)

This project presents a complete data analysis workflow on the Ford GoBike trip dataset for January 2018. It covers everything from data cleaning and wrangling to univariate, bivariate, and multivariate explorations to uncover valuable user behavior patterns and business insights.

## ðŸ“š Project Overview

- **Dataset**: `201801-fordgobike-tripdata.csv`
- **Objective**:  
  - Understand user demographics and bike usage patterns.
  - Identify key trends across ride duration, gender, user types, and trip timings.
  - Provide actionable insights to enhance service planning and marketing strategies.

## ðŸ›  Key Steps in the Project

1. **Introduction and Dataset Understanding**  
   Brief overview of the dataset, features, and business context.

2. **Dataset Investigation and Pre-Wrangling**  
   - Checked for missing values and incorrect data types.
   - Performed feature engineering (e.g., calculating ride minutes, extracting start hour, member age).

3. **Further Data Wrangling**  
   - Removed outliers (extreme ride durations and unrealistic birth years).
   - Cleaned missing and inconsistent data entries.

4. **Univariate Exploration**  
   - Analyzed the distributions of ride duration, age, gender, user type, start hours, and days.

5. **Bivariate Exploration**  
   - Explored relationships between two variables like user type vs. ride duration, gender vs. ride duration, age vs. ride duration.

6. **Multivariate Exploration**  
   - Combined multiple factors to uncover deeper patterns (e.g., gender, user type, and ride times).

7. **Conclusion**  
   - Summarized findings and provided business-oriented recommendations.

## ðŸ“ˆ Tools and Libraries Used
